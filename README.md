# Covina High School Band Website
This is the base for an overhaul of Covina High School's band [website](https://www.covinaband.com/). The website is currently hosted through Google Sites and therefore does not have much room for freedom with layout design and other complicated functionality.

To set up your local system for developing the website, refer to [this guide](./articles/DEVELOPMENTSETUP.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Full documentation is not complete yet, but it will be updated frequently. Anyone should be able to navigate through important information by going through the README.
